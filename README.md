# Dice App

This project will involve:
- useState hook
- handling input data

# Made using

- React


###### Note:
Every time you see 1dN (e.g. 1d6, 1d20), I mean "I have rolled one N-sided die", such as a 6-sided die.

# Task 

Create a Dice app.

It should have a button. On click, the button will roll a number between 1 and 6.

The number rolled should be displayed below it. Every time the button is clicked, it should add the number
to the output, or log of clicks, in a new p tag going from most recent roll at the top to least recent at the bottom.

# What I learned 

For me the hardest part of learning React is learning a new way of getting my thoughts and ideas onto the page. I find Javascript(Vanilla) very logical and I can quickly get my ideas working. With React, this takes time and takes my brain away from thining about the problem to instead thinking about the syntax. I'm sure that with more exercises, this will change.
